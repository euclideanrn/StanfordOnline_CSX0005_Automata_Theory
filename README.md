# Automata Theory

## Course Outline
The course is divided into 6 modules of videos and homeworks and a final exam. In the synchronous version of the course, each module is intended to be covered in one week. However, you are free to spend more or less time on each module. Here is a sketch of the content of the six weeks of videos:
1. Finite automata, including the deterministic and nondeterministic versions
2. Regular expressions, their equivalence to finite automata, properties of the languages defined by regular expressions and finite automata
3. Context-free grammars and languages
4. Pushdown automata, their equivalence to context-free grammars, properties of context-free languages, introduction to Turing machines
5. Turing machines, decidability, undecidable problems
6. The classes P and NP, NP-complete problems
